## Hardware
Files are available in both Mesh (.stl) and Solid (.DWG) formats. Hardware was primarily printed using a custom FDM-style printing system in PLA unless otherwise stated. 
Some projects including the custom culture chips were printed on an SLA-based system (FORM3) in bio-compatible Dental-SG resin.

## Software
Software written for the bio-printer includes a custom MarlinV2 build designed specifically for bio-prionting.
Additional software and scripts to run environmental feedback via the "pi-control"

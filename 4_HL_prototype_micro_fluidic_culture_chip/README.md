# Chambered organoid culture chips  
This repository contains the open source designs for our ongoing multi-organoid culture chambers used to culture multiple organoids and perform automated perfusion + media changes. 

The Organ-on-chip designs are still in eartly prototyping phases and are currently manufactured as stated below:
- Positive master subtrate is designed for and manufactured with an SLA 3D printer (FORM3 with dental-sg resin)
- Subtrates are cured in UV at 60degrees for >2 hours and extensively washed in Isopropyl alcohol.
- PDMS-PEG block co-polymer is cast on the subtrate resulting in negative imprints of subtrate milli-structures (perfusiuon channels and wells)
- Bio-printer is utilised to lay cell-laden inks in defined layers
- Chips are perfused with a syringe pump contianing media. 

## Future updates:
- V3 chips will include side perfusion chambers and a larger microfluidic mixing circuit.
- Peristeltic perfusion pump system can optiinally be used in place of the syringe pump (using the same bio-printer/HL_robot_controller controller interface)

# Laminar flow hepa cabinet

# This directory contains plans and 3D printable parts for the contruction of a laminar flow, hepa-filtered hood for general purpose work. This Cabinet was designed in response to the call for production of faceshields and associated PPE during the 2020 COVID19 crisis. The cabinet was used primarily for the safe-handling and sterilisation of 3D-printed PPE units prior to distribution. 

The prototype contruction contsists of sealed MDF panels, off-the-shelf hepa filter catridges and a in-line ducted extractor fan.

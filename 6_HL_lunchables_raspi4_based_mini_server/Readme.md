# 6_HL_lunchables_raspi4_based_mini_server

This directory contains 3D printable models for individual units that maybe assembled to form a "micro-cluster" running Docker-swarm. Each unit is designed to accept a PI4 unit, a PI4 compute unit, or a lattepanda alpha SBC.

Individually, each node is capable of running independent of the cluster unit and provides a the user an Jupyterlab IDE environment for learning data analysis.

The HaniffaLab bio-printer project is an open-source resource dedicated to creating freely available parametric models for operational bio-printers.
V1 of the haniffalab Bio-printer utilises the base frame and steppers from any "MP-mini" 3D printer model (1,2,pro). V1 contains custom firmware, additional opensource and low-cost electronics and 3D printed modifications which convert the base pinter into a multi-extruder system.

V1.1 additional purchased hardware:
Ramps1.4
RepRap full graphic controller
HW-134 stepper drivers (1/16 stepped)
Arduino mega2560
Pi3B+
Elegoo 3.5inch SPI touch TFT screen 

V1.1 additonal (non-custom designed) 3D printed hardware:
graphic controller case: (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2813298)

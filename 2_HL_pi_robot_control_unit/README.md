# HL Robot control and environmental monitor unit
This system is essentially a shell and case for a pi4, 10,000mah battery pack, and the 7inch Pi screen. It features GPIO access points and runs software written to integrate with the HL bio-printer and environment monitor units.

The primary function of this unit within the bio-printing system is as a sub-system to provide environmental monitering data to the bio-printer and relay printing metrics and settings remotely to the user.

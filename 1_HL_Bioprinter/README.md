# Haniffalab Bioprinter

This repository contains 3D-printable files and software designed and used in the Haniffalab Bio-printing system. 3D printed hardware were printed on an FDM system with PLA unless otherwise appended with "SLA", which were printed with a resin-based printer.

## Additional materials:
	MP mini pro (Only structural components and steppers required, may be substituted with any cartersian-style frame)
	Ramps1.4
  	RepRap full graphic controller-graphic controller case: (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2813298)
	HW-134 stepper drivers (1/16 stepped)
	Arduino mega2560
  	Pi3B+
  	Elegoo 3.5inch SPI touch TFT screen 
## Notes:
	- This system runs on a custom flvaour of the Marlin firmware interfacing with an octoprint instance on the Raspberry PI computer. The system may be run indepdently of an external controller or be interfaced with custom print programs and/or the HL-robotic controller interface for further sensor integration.

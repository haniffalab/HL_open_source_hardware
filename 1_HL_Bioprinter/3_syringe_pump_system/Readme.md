## Bio-printer syringe pump system
This syringe pump system was deisnged taking inspriation from the 'Poseiden syringe pump' project (**https://github.com/haniffalab/HL_open_source_hardware/blob/main/1_HL_Bioprinter/media5.mp4**)

### Crank aggitation mechanism
This directory contains CAD files for the prodcution of a magentically driven linear agitator which prevents cells and ECM matrerial in bio-inks

### v2_syringe_pump_system
this directory contains prototype designs for a syringe pump system which integrates peltier units for differetial cooling/heating of the bio-inks. This peltier system integrates with the HL_robotic controller unit and can be programmed to keep bioinks warm/cool.
